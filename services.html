          <p>In our nutritional medicine consultations, we use evidence-based research to assist in our case taking and to develop individually tailored nutritional prescriptions for our clients.
            A focus on your nervous system, gut health, sleep patterns, exercise and diet will all be taken into consideration.</p>
          <p>Our initial consultations are 75 minutes long and include a thorough case taking of your presenting symptom(s),
            a diet analysis and may include some physical examinations, such as taking your blood pressure or a body composition analysis.
            At the end of the consultation, you will receive a nutritional prescription which may include practitioner only nutritional supplementation,
            dietary modifications (food as medicine), and lifestyle advice.</p>
          <p class="note"><em>Note: Due to Covid-19 Straight Up Nutrition is only offering Telehealth consultations at this time through secure encrypted video conferencing.</em></p>

            Followed by a recolonisation of healthy bacteria such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria.

          <p>Did you know that preconception in men is just as important as it is in women? This program is designed to help both partners achieve maximum wellness in preparation to conceive. It is preferable for both partners to start preconception at
            least three months before trying for a baby.
            This program includes detoxifying the body and your environment, as well as dietary advice and nutritional supplementation to ensure the best genetic material is on offer from both partners.</p>

          <p>It is likely that once you fall pregnant you will get nutrition advice from your GP, obstetrician or midwife, which is a great starting place.
            However, if you are looking for more specific advice on how to achieve your daily recommended intakes of iron, zinc, protein, DHA, etc...
            during each trimester of pregnancy look no further. We will offer you specific nutrition advice for each trimester of pregnancy and recommend
            high quality practitioner only nutritional supplements to ensure your little one is getting the best start!</p>
