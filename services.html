          <p>In my nutritional medicine consultations, I use evidence-based research to assist in my case taking and to develop individually tailored nutritional prescriptions for my clients.
            A focus on your nervous system, gut health, sleep patterns, exercise and diet will all be taken into consideration.</p>
          <p>Never been to a nutritionist before and wondering what to expect? <br>
            My initial consultation is 75 minutes long and includes a thorough case taking of your presenting complaint, a diet analysis and may include some physical examinations, such as taking your blood pressure or a body composition analysis.
            At the end of the consultation you will receive a nutritional prescription which may include practitioner only nutritional supplementation, dietary modifications (food as medicine), and lifestyle advice.</p>

          <p>Feeling a little sluggish or maybe your mood is a little low? A general wellbeing program is tailored to your needs and can help put a little pep in your step!
            Whether you want to increase your vitality through food as medicine or utilise nutritional supplementation to help you through a stressful life event, I’m here to help.</p>

          <h3 class="card-title">Love Your Guts</h3>
          <p>Poor gut health has been linked to low immunity, low mood, increased inflammation and even obesity (read my blog – What the Guts?).
            Love your guts is a four-week program aimed to heal and seal the gut. Followed by a recolonisation of healthy bacteria such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria.
            If you currently experience ongoing flatulence, bloating, burping, reflux, indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, or undigested food in stools this program is a must.</p>

          <h3 class="card-title">Preconception Boot Camp</h3>
          <p>Did you know that preconception in men is just as important as it is in women? This program is designed to help both partners achieve maximum wellness in preparation to conceive. It is preferable for both partners to start preconception at
            least three months before trying for a baby.
            This program includes detoxifying the body and your environment, as well as dietary advice and nutritional supplementation to ensure the best genetic material is on offer from both partners.</p>

          <h3 class="card-title">Eating for Pregnancy</h3>
          <p>It is likely that once you fall pregnant you will get nutrition advice from your GP, obstetrician or midwife, which is a great starting place.
            However, if you are looking for more specific advice on how to achieve your daily recommended intake of iron, zinc, protein, DHA, etc... during each trimester of pregnancy look no further. I will offer you specific nutrition advice for each
            trimester of pregnancy and will also recommend high quality practitioner only nutritional supplements to ensure your little one is getting the best start!</p>
